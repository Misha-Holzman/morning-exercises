## Interview Questions

1. Write a function called factorial() that takes a number and multiplies up all numbers from 1 through that number. Example: factorial(5) should equal 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5.

   ```js
   const factorial = (num) => {
    // code in here
   }
   ```

2. Write a function called fibonacci() that takes a number n and returns the fibonacci sequence as an array up to the nth element. For example, fibonacci(5) should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].
   
   ```js
   const fibonacci = (n) => {
    let sequence = [0, 1];
    // code in here
   }
   ```

3. Write a function called isPrime() that returns a boolean depending on whether or not a given number is a prime number or not. For example, isPrime(5) should return true, whereas isPrime(4) should return false.
   
   ```js
   const isPrime = (n) => {
    // code in here
   }
   ```
